    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=2D:80:CF:69:33:E1:57:02:B9:AD:9E:9E:57:05:C8:49:41:C3:F4:E0%3Bcom.example.schoolapp

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    com.example.schoolapp

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    2D:80:CF:69:33:E1:57:02:B9:AD:9E:9E:57:05:C8:49:41:C3:F4:E0

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
